### Heart Rate Monitors (Arm Band)
+ HRM worn on the upper arm, primarily for using during swimming or activities for which chest straps are not well suited. These HRMs typically use optical (PPG) sensors, and support Bluetooth (for smartphone connectivity) and ANT+ (for sports and gym equipment connectivity).  
+ Examples: Polar Verity Sense / OH1+, Wahoo TICKR FIT.  

### Fitness Trackers
+ Activity and fitness tracking armbands, or pods worn with specially-designed clothing.  
+ Examples: WHOOP 4.0, Xiaomi Mi Smart Band.  

### Connected Blood Pressure Monitors (Arm Cuff)
+ Connected BP monitors placed on the upper arm, sometimes with additional sensors for HR, SPO2, or ECG.  
+ Examples: Garmin BPM, iHealth Neo / Track, Omron Evolv Upper Arm / Gold / 7 / 9 / Complete, Oxiline Pressure XS, Withings BPM Connect / Core, Wellue BP2.

### Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs)
+ Skin patches or subcutaneous implants that provide continuous estimated blood glucose values, primarily using a small needle/sensor that detects glucose in interstitial fluids. Some CGMs can be integrated with insulin pumps in open-loop or closed-loop (automated insulin delivery, or artificial pancreas) systems, and typically connect to smartphones via Bluetooth.  
+ Some models can also be worn on the abdomen or upper buttocks.  
+ Examples (Rx-only): Abbott Freestyle Libre 14-day / 2 / 3, Dexcom G6 / G7, Medtronic Guardian Connect Sensor 3 / Simplera, Senseonics Eversense E3 / 365, etc.  
+ Examples (OTC): Abbott Lingo / Libre Rio, Dexcom Stelo, etc.

### Temperature Patches
+ Skin sensors to measure body core temperature. Depending on the model, some are worn on the underarms for axillary body temperature, forehead, or chest. They typically connect to smartphones via Bluetooth or NFC, and to other sports devices via ANT+.  
+ Examples (Rx-only): TempTraq, Vivalink Axillary Temperature Sensor.  
+ Examples (OTC): greenTEG CORE Sensor, SteadySense STEADYTEMP Sensor Patch.

### Smart Glasses
+ Current smart glasses/frames and AI/AR/VR/XR headsets generally lack inertial and biometric sensors needed for research. However, a few brands have been introducing more sensors.  
+ Examples: Amazon Echo Frames, Magic Leap 2 AR Headset, Microoled Engo, QIDI Vida.  

### Earbuds / Headphones / Headbands
+ We are not currently aware of ear pieces with biometric sensors. However, some devices can be used for hearing tests (e.g. Apple AirPods Pro 2).  

### Other Neck and Head Devices
+ Additional devices may include: sleep monitor masks, swimming AR glasses, HRM swim goggle clip-on pods, jaw tracking devices, anti-snoring devices; and by prescription only: PAP and Dry EEG / EMG devices.

### Heart Rate Monitor Chest Straps
+ Popular in fitness and exercise science, chest straps can stream heart rate measures to multiple devices via Bluetooth or ANT+.  
+ Examples: Garmin HRM Fit/Dual/Swim/Pro Plus, Polar H9/H10/T31 coded, Wahoo TRACKR HEART RATE, Wellue VisualBeat HRM patch/strap.  

### Sleep Position Pods

### Future Enhancements Needed
+ Use the Sketchfab JavaScript API to add annotations programatically, and keep them in CSV. Use GitHub Pages to publish the finished pages with JS and embed code.
+ Alternatively, do something similar without third parties by utilizing a different, open source JS 3D library that can run on the client side.
